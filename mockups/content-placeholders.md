### 📖 Short Bio / About Section

**Version 1: Professional**
```
I'm Shreyansh, a full-stack developer with a passion for creating intuitive and impactful digital experiences. With expertise spanning front-end frameworks to back-end architecture, I specialize in building scalable web applications that solve real-world problems.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new design trends, watching anime, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in clean code, thoughtful design, and continuous learning.

Currently focused on modern web technologies including React, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure. Always open to exciting opportunities and collaborations.
```

**Version 2: Casual & Personal**
```
Hey, I'm Shreyansh! I build things for the web—from sleek user interfaces to robust back-end systems. I love the challenge of turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions.

My journey in tech started with curiosity and a laptop, and has evolved into a deep passion for full-stack development. I'm particularly drawn to projects that combine technical excellence with great user experience.

Outside of work, I'm an anime enthusiast, a minimalist design advocate, and someone who believes that good software should feel invisible—it just works.
```

**Version 3: Brief & Punchy**

Full-stack developer. Problem solver. Design enthusiast.

I build web applications that are fast, scalable, and user-friendly. From concept to deployment, I handle the entire stack—React and TypeScript on the front end, Node.js and databases on the back end, and everything in between.

Passionate about clean code, brutalist design, and creating digital experiences that matter.

### 🎨 Diary Entry Samples

**Entry 1: November 1, 2025**
```
Today was incredibly productive. Finished the design mockups for the personal diary app. The minimalist brutalist aesthetic is coming together nicely.

The vertical split on the landing page creates a strong visual separation between personal and professional life. Clean, sharp, intentional.

Need to implement the anime grid tomorrow. The masonry layout will add visual interest while maintaining the overall minimalist approach.
```

**Entry 2: November 2, 2025**
```
Started working on the wallet feature. Progress bars with flat design look great against the yellow gradient background.

The brutalist approach of no shadows and sharp corners really emphasizes the content over decoration. Every element serves a purpose.

Portfolio section coming along well. The cursive name adds a personal touch while keeping the overall aesthetic bold and modern.
```

**Entry 3: November 3, 2025**
```
Reflection day. Looking back at the projects I've completed this year, I'm proud of how far I've come. Each challenge taught me something new.

The task management app was particularly rewarding—seeing teams actually use something I built and hearing their feedback was incredible.

Next quarter goals: learn more about microservices architecture, contribute to more open-source projects, and maybe start a tech blog.
